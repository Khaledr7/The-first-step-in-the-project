# Toy Project 'bikya'
## Problem Statement
Our idea revolves around recycling. We have taken this issue to heart,
because we believe that recycling is a duty that every human being must contribute to
 to preserve the environment that contains us as human beings.
In our first year of CS&CE, we designed a website that helps encourage people to recycle,
 so, we transferred this idea to computer vision,
so, we wrote a code that helps to recognize the existing waste so that we can collect, classify and recycle it.
We have come up with a clear and specific code for classifying an object
 , we are now trying to develop it to do other tasks to
 encourage people to recycle like rewards and introduce people who are interested in the same topic. 
 ## Learning Process
 We have used the programming language Python, IDE Pycharm and Open-CV.
We did a lot of research and watched a lot of videos and saw that we can solve our problem in many ways, but the method that we used is the easiest way and we will show you in a presentation all the possible ways.
We learned during the construction of the project how to work jointly in one team and how to divide the work among us, and these are the most important things and the most important qualities that we learned in that competition.
And we have learned how to make projects that work with the same idea.
# Coding Competition
## Problem Statement
We faced a problem that we want to deliver this idea to homes because it is the largest waste product. 
We thought to create a website and developed it to the point that it could identify an object by just a camera,
so it became easier to use and more efficient, which reduces the userâ€™s error rate.

## Solution
 * Many solutions appeared to us, most of them are very complex to solve our problem,
but we found a simple and easy to implement solution for us so that we can recognise the object,
which is recognition by dimensions.
## Methodology 
 * we used open-cv
